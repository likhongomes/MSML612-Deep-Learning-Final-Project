## Running the project
- Create a Data folder in the project directory
- Save the 2023, 2024, and 2024 Parking Violations folders from the project Google Drive into the Data folder. 
- Run initial_data_cleaning.ipynb and then run time_series_converting.ipynb
- Run TabTransformer_Daily_Model_Test.ipynb


## Final Report Guide
In your final report (paper), you will provide detailed information about your project, including:

- Abstract
- Problem Statement
- Related Work (any related work included in the literature)
- Your Architecture and its Significance (novelties, if any)
- Evaluation Results (quantitative results based on well-established metrics)
- Limitations/Future Scope

in addition to the standard information you've previously provided such as 

- Name of the group members (>=3 and <=5 students)
- Each member's achieved contribution
- Implementation tools, you've used

you are also required to include the source code for your development. Please include any softcopy artifacts, such as source code and the database, with your submission. These may be in the form of a URL to an external repository.

You will be graded based on the following criteria:

[1] Data prep/curation â€“ time sequence data (10)
    Amount of data collected, processed and curated. 
[2] Difficulty of NN design and implementation â€“ transformer model (25)
    You are allowed to follow one of the existing implementations so long as you cite the resource and adapt it to your problem space. Complexity of your transformer model for an increased performance may be the key.
[3] Working, clean, readable code (without any extra work to reproduce the same results) (20)
[4] High performance (length of time sequence, running time of prediction, etc.) (25)
[5] Paper (typo-free, grammatically correct report and presentation that includes necessary tables and figures illustrating the novelty and evaluation results) (10)
[6] References (literature review/related work) (10)

One submission per group is sufficient.
